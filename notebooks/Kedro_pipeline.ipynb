I called today because I had not heard from them. They told me that I had to send all the information again along with a power of attorney in order to get a reply from them. Like they don't keep a file of anything. This is ridiculous. We want to reduce credit fraud. It should be much easier to report a person 's death. The credit bureaus should accept a notice from the funeral parlors. If social security accepts a notice from the funeral parlor to stop payments, why can't credit bureaus have an easier process to prevent thieves from stealing a dead person 's identity. It is also ridiculous to require a power of attorney before informing a spouse that her deceased husband 's credit account is secure. This is an issue that should be addressed by the government. Protecting the deceased from identity theft should be an authomated process and should not require multiple communications with each credit bureau and lack of cooperation from the credit bureaus.\"],\n",

I called before XXXX holiday and talked with another person from Ally Bank and told them I had reported Ally Bank to the Federal Trade Commission and the resolution I want is my money back and for my accounts with Ally to be cancelled and they better not have done a credit check on me. It is now XXXX XXXX, the day after XXXX XXXX. I called again just now and talked to someone on Ally Bank and gave them all of my info again ( I do this every time I call ) but they still wo n't unblock my account and this time I got hung up on probably when the guy put me on hold he did it wrong. Or perhaps they just want to rub it in. Basically I thought I was getting a good deal because my personal savings account offers 0.10 % interest rate but Ally Bank verified me, took my money, and then declared me fraudulent. So how do I get my money back??? I already passed their verification test and they sent me an email saying they were sending me a signature card to sign in the mail. So if they could in fact not verify me why did they transfer the money? Now they wo n't give it back. They ca n't operate this way. My financial institution where my personal checking and savings are with has agreed to dispute the transfers to Ally Bank so I 'll be going in later to fill out paper work. Also when filling out the online application for Ally Bank after ward it asked me questions about my credit report. That was weird. I was never told at any time during the application process my credit would be checked. I asked a person when I called Ally Bank but they did n't answer my question. If Ally Bank did check my credit without telling me I will be unhappy about that and they need to take that off my credit reports if they did and put a statement on their website that says they check credit reports when signing up. I signed up with a different online account just for savings a few months ago and that online savings account does not do not do credit checks of applicants so I was expecting the same thing from Ally Bank as they have no statement about credit being checked when applying for any accounts. Also on XXXX, yesterday, I received an email from Ally Bank saying I have a secure message from them and to sign into my account. I ca n't I tried again but because they believe my account to be fraudulent and they want me to prove I am who I am. If they believe my account to be fraudulent then why are they sending emails to me to log into my account? Something is not right, Ally Bank is screwing with my personal info and my money. After typing up this report I tried to sign in again with Ally Bank and my account is still blocked. So I 'm figuring the guy I talked to 56 minutes ago really did hang up on me on purpose. All of this nonsense for a total of {$20.00}? Really? That 's how much I setup to be transferred in total to Ally Bank.\"],\n",

       "  ['This is a multifaceted problem. I took this loan out for emergency repairs to my home, approximately {$25000.00}. As I had just purchased my home, my credit options were limited. The contractor I hired offered Greensky as a financing option. ( My issue is not with the contractor ). Prior to accepting the loan, I carefully read the terms, however, since accepting, I\\'m finding some of their practices to be deceptive, predatory, and unethical. First of all, the loan is presented as a \" credit card. \\'\\' I believe this is a loophole to avoid usury laws. \\n\\nThe terms of the loan are essentially that I have one year to pay off the loan in full. If it is not paid off within that time, I automatically owe the interest for the full term of the loan, regardless of how quickly I pay it off. This will result in automatically being charged approximately {$29000.00} in interest on a {$25000.00} loan, again, regardless of how quickly I pay off the loan. The payments I make now only go toward the interest, but if I pay it off within the promotion period, those payments are applied to the principal. As such, my credit report reflects that I have not made any payments on the loan. It still shows the full balance. In fact, it often shows that I am over the {$25000.00} credit limit, because although it is zero percent interest for 12 months, they are still billing me as though I\\'m paying monthly interest. \\n\\nMy plan from the beginning was to refinance the loan at the end of the term. The real issue arises in that because the company is reporting 1 ) that the balance has not decreased, and 2 ) that I am over limit, this loan is having substantial negative impact on my credit score, thus eliminating my chances of qualifying for a loan to refinance. Since taking out this loan, my credit score has dropped 80-100 points. My score went from about 755 to about 628, despite paying off a credit card, and several hard inquiries dropping off my report. I believe this company does this on purpose, in order to keep customers trapped in this loan. \\n\\nAdditionally, I\\'d like to point out that although I was truthful in my application, I was shocked that this company gave me {$25000.00} without asking for a single piece of documentation. It seemed absurd to me, especially in light of the fact I had just taken out a mortgage a month or so before. This leads me to believe this is a predatory lender that gives out loans with no regard for the customer \\'s actual ability to repay. \\n\\nThere are many shady, deceptive, predatory things going on with this loan.

The first of these purchases were XXXX XXXX Gift Cards. I was to use a credit card that had a high balance on it. The company employing me would make a payment on this balance and then I would use the resulting credit to purchase the XXXX XXXX gift cards.\\nI used the credit cards mobile app to see when the payments were made, when the credit was available and when the charges for the gift cards would appear on my account.\\nMy starting credit card balance was a little over {$7000.00}.\\nThe company employing me authorized a payment to my credit card on X/XX/17 in the amount of {$4500.00}. When that showed on the credit cards mobile app as available credit on X/XX/2017 ... I used the avaiable credit to buy {$3900.00} in XXXX XXXX  cards.\\nThe company employing me instucted me to make a XXXX XXXX dollar payment to my credit card when the first XXXX XXXX  purchase was applied to my balance. So on XX/XX/2017 I made a {$6100.00} payment from thier bank to my credit card account.\\nWhen that payment resulted in the mobile app indicating I had the available credit on X/XX/2017, I purchased another {$6000.00} worth of XXXX XXXX cards.\\nI waited until the charges for those cards appeared on my credit card mobile app and then as instructed on X/XX/2017 I made another {$6100.00} payment from my employers bank to my credit card.\\nWhen that payment showed as available credit on the mobile app on X/XX/2017, I made another purchase of {$6000.00} worth of XXXX XXXX cards as instructed.

I never would have charged the XXXX XXXX cards had they waited the 15 days to show the credit was available. The payments would have been reversed before then and I would have not had the credit available.\\nI feel my credit card company aided in this scam by showing available credit when they should not have. I spoke with the credit card company several times and no one could answer my questions about why the available credit showed on my mobile app. They said it was standard procedure to post payments on accounts before the 15 day reversal period is over.

       "  ['On XX/XX/XXXX, {$240.00} dollars were taken from my Checking account at Fifth Third Bank and transferred to XXXX via 4 charges of {$19.00}, {$24.00}, {$99.00} and {$99.00} in XXXX XXXX I promptly filed a dispute for all of these charges to their Disputes Resolutions Department and, the next day, was granted a provisional credit the next day of the total {$240.00} while the Disputes Department \" investigated \\'\\'. \\n\\nAt the end of the same month on XX/XX/XXXX, {$220.00} of the provisional credit ( the charges of {$99.00}, {$99.00}, {$24.00}, {$19.00} ) was reversed as a result of the disputes being partially denied. This briefly caused an overdraft in my account and a huge portion of the paycheck I\\'d received that morning was taken from me. \\n\\nI called them immediately to figure out why the dispute was denied and they explained that \" the merchant presented information showing that the charges were valid. \\'\\' The information is simply my already having a XXXX Account prior to the funds transfer and the {$19.00} and {$24.00} being used for Product Purchases. \\n\\nThe denials obviously make no sense whatsoever for several reasons : 1. I  DIDN\\'T EVEN HAVE MY XXXX XXXX AT THE TIME AND YOU NEED TO INPUT PERSONAL INFO. I ONLY I KNEW TO MAKE PURCHASES! \\n\\n2. The dispute for the {$19.00} was approved yet the other charges were denied, even though all of these charges occurred on the same day. Nothing makes the one charge any more legitimate than others. If anything, the disputes for the 2 charges of {$99.00} should be more likely to be approved than the smaller amounts. I don\\'t even know of any game or XXXX on XXXX Store that costs {$99.00}. \\n\\n3. XXXX XXXX was completely empty ( not even a cent ) even after the alleged \" purchases \\'\\' were made. In addition, I could find no record of any purchases associated with the 2 charges of {$99.00} in my Transaction History on my XXXX Account ( online ). \\n\\n4. If there was funding made to my XXXX account, my XXXX XXXX should\\'ve renewed as my account was to auto-renew. However, my Transaction History explicitly states there are \" missing charges \\'\\' the same day. In other words, there was nothing stating my XXXX XXXX renewed even when my account was funded, and I need XXXX to play most games. \\n\\n5. The auto-renewals for XXXX XXXX is only {$9.00}. There is nothing to warrant any further charges without my consent. \\n\\n6. The merchant, XXXX, presented no information what these products were that costed {$19.00} and {$24.00} ; 53 Bank merely took these Product Purchases at face value. \\n\\n7. My word should be good enough! The money started from my account, and I promptly reported that these charges were unauthorized the same day the funds were transferred. It\\'s not like I\\'m trying to steal any money from the bank ; I\\'m merely trying to have my own money returned to me. With that in mid, my word that the funds transfers were unauthorized should\\'ve trumped any superficial information XXXX presented. No possible harm is done from giving my money back to me. \\n\\nThe denials for these Disputes are clearly the result of incompetence, irresponsibility, sloth, and/or corruption among Fifth Third \\'s Disputes Department. \\n\\nI, of course, called Fifth Third Bank the next day on XX/XX/XXXX to talk to them about the Provisional Credit Reversal and upon discussing the dispute denials, I immediately emailed them information ( my Transaction history and XXXX XXXX, attached below ) and they re-opened the case. They stated it would take at least 14 days and up to 30 days for investigator to resolve the case ... \\n\\nIt is currently XX/XX/XXXX and it has been at least 30 days since this Dispute case has been re-opened. Not only has the case not been resolved but the investigators have yet to even come to conclusion at all. Mind you, this is a process that mostly involves exchanging a few emails with the merchant and looking at pictures ( as basically described the bank department \\'s own representatives ). \\n\\nOver the course of this last month, I\\'ve made at least 10 or more phone calls to Fifth Third \\'s Customer Support and Disputes Resolutions Department, yet the only answers I get are apologies for my inconveniences while they lifted no finger to fix it. I\\'ve even had one of the Department \\'s workers ( someone above the representatives by the name of \" XXXX \\'\\' ) hang up on me after repeating \" Your 30 days are not up \\'\\'. I asked them multiple times to put me through to the working investigator, but they just simply claim that they are unable to give their information or contact the investigators themselves. I may be wrong but this is a Fortune 500 company we\\'re talking about. What kind of company as large, powerful, and productive as Fifth Third can\\'t even contact investigators that THEY are contracting? \\n\\nI understand that these alleged \" investigators \\'\\' are obviously swamped with several cases beside my mine \\'s, but considering my case is the result of the Disputes Resolutions Department \\'s own ERROR, I would think they at least show some effort in trying to return the money they allowed to be taken from me in the first place. All they\\'ve done is supposedly leave little notes for the investigators without actually making direct contact with them to make sure they\\'re actually doing their job properly, for the benefit of THE BANK \\'S customers. \\n\\nIsn\\'t the fact that these alleged \" investigators \\'\\' are dealing with so many re-opened Disputes cases partial proof of the Fifth Third \\'s hazardous incompetence in the Disputes Resolutions Department? That itself is speculative on my part but I\\'ve seen so many people on social media complaining about similar issues with the same department. The Provisional Credit Reversal caused SEVERAL inconveniences for me financially and now, I\\'m worried I\\'ll never see my {$240.00} fully returned to me like it should have been. \\n\\nIn summary : A merchant ( XXXX ) took {$240.00} from my Checking account. When I disputed these charges as being unauthorized with the bank, 53 Bank tricked me into a line of credit under the guise of conducting an investigation. After I told them the merchant ( or some employee working there ) STOLE this money from me, they basically NEGOTIATED for PART of MY money, and allowed the merchant to keep MOST of it. \\n\\nDoes that sound legitimate at all? \\n\\nI am not a wealthy man. I have expenses that must be paid. I had very important plans for the paycheck I\\'d made on the week of XXXX XXXX and those plans were completely ruined when Fifth Third Bank took my money from me.'],\n",

While living there, her upstairs neighbors had a water leak that caused damages to my daughter 's apartment. She notified the apartment complex management, and they attempted to fix the damage. The carpet in one of the rooms was soaking wet and the complex attempted to dry it out. After she moved out, the apartment complex stated that she owed them for the cost of the carpet ( {$250.00} ). She denied being the cause of the damage. The apartment complex sold this debt to Procollect. I was the surety on the apartment lease. Since the damage was caused by XXXX XXXX 's negligence, I told Procollect that XXXX XXXX was at fault and we were not responsible for the damage to the carpet. I sent Procollect documentation regarding this. Procollect says that it is a valid debt.\"],\n",
